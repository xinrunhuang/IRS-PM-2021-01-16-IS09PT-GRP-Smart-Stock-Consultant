## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
With the increasing social economy and better living conditions, more and more people choose stock investment as financial management. The investors’ most concern of stock is how to predict the stock tendency correctly. There are many factors affecting stocks, such as companies' operating conditions, countries’ policies and so on. Consequently, an efficient and precise stock prediction is one of hottest field today.

Nowadays, AI application is more and more extensive, applied to every bit of our life, and it begins to be applied to stock decision-making, overcoming the inaccuracy of traditionally mathematical statistics on companies’ basic information. The inaccuracy of traditional method may be caused by delay of the company's information or national policy etc. While AI can learn and tune itself, what’s more, it has the advantage of good fault tolerance compared with traditional methods.

Therefore, our team decide to build a machine learning model to predict the stock trend. First, we collect the historical stock data over 15 years from 30 companies ranked by its market capitalization. Then we calculate the 11 technical indicators as the features. After that we build the random forest model and fit the data to train our model. Our system has three main functions: prediction, recommendation and chatbot. Based on our trained model and current data, we would tell the user whether this company’s stock will rise or not. Our system also recommends users the valuable stocks which is going to rise today and has potential to earn highest money. In addition, our system integrates with chatbot, making it available and easy for users to communicate with our system through Q&A chatbot, saving a lot of money on consulting on economical expert.
